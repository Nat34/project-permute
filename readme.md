Processing Development Environment

This repository contains files and documentation created during the setup, creation and development of a program using Processing.  This project was developed in conjunction with the course *Creative Engagements with Digital Technology* at the Univeristy of Pittsburgh.

## Project: 
To generate a tool that will produce a grid of rectangles structured around a permutation of three colors, where order is important and repetition is allowed. 

## Drivers: 
The drivers behind this project are to learn programming basics, to understand the fundamentals of computer graphics, to produce a visually appealing artwork and tool, to save time in experimentation with color arrangements and to engage with the community of artists, students, designers, programmers and educators who use this technology.  

The Processing approach to programming made learning these basics understandable and fun.  This approach is informed through a context within design and the arts, where it is easy to write, generate and modify images, drawings, animations as well as the integration of audio, video and exportation to the web.  Processing made it possible to understand the code elements, the syntax, comments, functions, expressions, statement, arrays, etc while introducing software concepts in the context of the arts.  Learning within this context enabled me to learn about the fundamentals of computer graphics as well.  For example, understanding that a position on the screen is comprised of an x-coordinate and y-coordinate and that a point is the simplest visual element.  

Producing a visually appealing artwork and tool began with thinking about the aesthetics of the color arrangement within a defined structure, but took on another meaning as coding this program progressed.  As my code evolved to make the program shorter and more modular, the beauty in concise and well constructed code emerged.  I have a penchant for repetition, which is why saving time in experimentation with color arrangements based on a permutation was a goal of mine for this project.  With Processing, I was able to exercise control over the time spent executing these permutations.  Finally, engaging with the community of those using Processing as a way to discuss and share advice informed this project.  My first interaction with the Processing forum yielded code too complex for me to generate alone.  Because of this interaction I was able to move forward with my project in a way I didn’t think possible.  

I believe this project helped develop and explain my understanding of creativity and technology, took advantage of collaboration through web-based communities, helped strengthen my ability to access a digital tool and generated a creative project and presentation well suited for further exploration.  Processing helped develop and explain my understanding of creativity and technology because I was able to explore my ideas directly while simultaneously learning basic programming techniques and theory.  It took advantage of the skills of the members of this community to help drive the project in a meaningful direction.  The online and text-based reference tools helped educate me on topics like software, programming languages, ASCII, Unicode, Binary and order of operations, which strengthened my ability to use and evaluate digital tools.  The final products of this project, which include code, a program, a presentation and a web-based version of the program, are all suitable for public consumption as part of my artist and information professional portfolio.

## Technology:  
The technology in use for this project is Processing, a software that integrates a development environment and programming language.  The name “Processing” is inspired by the core function of computers as processing machines and the project itself focusing on the “process” of creation rather than end results.  Processing has different programming modes, Java, Python and Android mode.  This enables the possibility to render sketches on different platforms and program in different ways.  For this project I am using the default programming mode Java.  The Processing programming language is its own programming language but it is built on Java and therefore has many similarities to it as well as differences (Fig. 1).  The Processing Development Environment (PDE) consists of a simple text editor for writing code, a series of menus and other functionality.  Downloading and installing the Processing software was straightforward and easy.  I am running the Processing software on a Windows operating system.  The Processing development environment is released as open source under the GPL.
